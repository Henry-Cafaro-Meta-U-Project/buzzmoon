Useful git commands for dealing with gh-pages nonsense

To remove dist files from being tracked, and ensure they are not committed to main repo:
  run "git rm -r --cached dist"

To update the deployed site in the gh-pages branch
  run "npm run build"
  run "git add dist -f"
  run "git commit -m `updated deployed distro`"
  run "git push origin `git subtree split --prefix buzzmoon-frontend/buzzmoon-vit
e/dist $CURRENTBRANCH`:gh-pages --force"

  the last command needs to be run from the root of the repository
